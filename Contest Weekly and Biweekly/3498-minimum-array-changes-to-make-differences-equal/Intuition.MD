Explanation:

1. The function `minChanges` takes an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k` as input.
2. It uses a HashMap `curDiffCount` to store the count of differences between symmetric elements in the array.
3. An array `oneOp` is used to count the number of pairs that can achieve each possible difference with one operation.
4. The main loop iterates through the first half of the array:

   - It calculates the difference between symmetric elements.
   - It updates the count of this difference in `curDiffCount`.
   - It calculates the maximum achievable difference with one operation and updates `oneOp`.
5. The code then calculates cumulative counts in `oneOp` from right to left.
6. Finally, it iterates through `curDiffCount` to find the minimum number of changes required:

   - For each difference, it calculates how many pairs can be fixed with one operation and how many need two operations.
   - It updates the answer `ans` if a smaller number of changes is found.

Dry Run:

Let's consider an example: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 4

1. Initialize:
   n = 4
   curDiffCount = {}
   oneOp = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
2. First iteration (i = 0):
   diff = |1 - 4| = 3
   curDiffCount = {3: 1}
   minEl = 1, maxEl = 4
   maxAchievableDiff = max(4 - 1, 4 - 0) = 3
   oneOp = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
3. Second iteration (i = 1):
   diff = |2 - 3| = 1
   curDiffCount = {3: 1, 1: 1}
   minEl = 2, maxEl = 3
   maxAchievableDiff = max(4 - 2, 3 - 0) = 3
   oneOp = [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
4. Calculate cumulative counts in oneOp:
   oneOp = [2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
5. Find minimum changes:
   For diff = 3:
   count = 1
   oneExtra = 2 - 1 = 1
   two = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0
   ans = min(INT_MAX, 1 + 0 * 2) = 1

   For diff = 1:
   count = 1
   oneExtra = 2 - 1 = 1
   two = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0
   ans = min(1, 1 + 0 * 2) = 1
6. Return ans = 1

So, the minimum number of changes required is 1.

This result means that we need to change only one number in the array to make all symmetric pairs have a difference of either 1 or 3. For example, we could change the second element from 2 to 4, resulting in the array [1, 4, 3, 4], where both symmetric pairs (1,4) and (4,3) have a difference of 3.
